 * Priority readout for the Reports table/cards — same "colored text, no

 * why tables use this plain in-row style rather than StatusBadge's
 * filled pill), but with a flag instead of a dot: priority isn't a
 * status, and a flag reads as "severity" in a way a status dot wouldn't.
 * Reuses the exact same four tones as every other status mapping in this
 * app rather than inventing new colors — see each Reports view's own
 * PRIORITY_TONE map for which tone means what here.
