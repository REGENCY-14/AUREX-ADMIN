/**
 * Imported 1:1 from the main AUREX site's components/PageTransition.tsx —
 * not one of the four files explicitly named in the Step 0 brief, but
 * brought in alongside lib/motion.ts since it's that file's own consumer
 * for "page transitions on navigation" (an explicit animation requirement
 * for this admin app) and defines no new variant of its own beyond
 * `routeTransition`, already imported. Flag if this wasn't wanted.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT wrapped in <AnimatePresence>: see the main site's own
 * copy of this file for why (a real, hard-to-reproduce bug with
 * AnimatePresence + the App Router got the exit phase stuck on a blank
 * page). What's left is an enter-only fade: React swaps the old keyed
 * element for the new one immediately, and the new page just fades in via
 * `routeTransition`. Less precious than a true crossfade, but nothing here
 * can get stuck.
