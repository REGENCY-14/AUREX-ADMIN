 * A business, from either of its two possible origins:

 *    same convention as MEMBERS in lib/members.ts. Swap
 *    getBusinesses()/createBusiness() for real apiFetch calls (like
 *    lib/packages.ts#createPackage) once one does.
 *  - "application": came from the Applications approval pipeline and
 *    has a real, backend-tracked funding listing (lib/businessListings.ts).
 *
 * getAllBusinesses() merges both into this one shape so admins manage
 * every business — self-added or member-owned, listed or not — from a
 * single Businesses page instead of two separate ones. Only
 * "application" rows carry a `listing` (and are editable, via the
 * existing lib/businessListings.ts#updateBusinessListing) since only
 * they have a real funding record behind them.
