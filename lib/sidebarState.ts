/**
 * Whether the admin sidebar is collapsed to its icon rail — kept as a
 * plain module-level variable (not a useState in AdminShell) for the
 * same reason lib/theme.ts keeps theme outside React: PageTransition
 * (components/PageTransition.tsx) keys its wrapper on `pathname`, which
 * remounts everything under it — AdminShell included — on every
 * navigation. A useState there would reset to its initial value on
 * every route change; a plain module variable survives, since the JS
 * module itself isn't what's remounting, only the React tree reading it.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT synced to localStorage (unlike theme) — per feedback,
 * the ask was "stay closed across navigation", not "across a browser
 * reload"; this app otherwise holds no client storage of its own (see
 * lib/theme.ts's own comment on why theme is the one scoped exception),
 * so a real page reload still starts expanded.
