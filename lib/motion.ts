// Same enter timing as pageTransition, opacity only — no `y`, and no
// `exit`. Used for the route-level transition in
// components/PageTransition.tsx, which:
//   - can't use `y`: that wrapper sits around each page's whole tree,
//     including any `fixed` chrome (a sidebar/topbar here), and any
//     `transform` (exactly how Framer Motion animates `y`) on an ancestor
//     creates a new containing block for `position: fixed` descendants — a
//     y-animated wrapper would briefly detach fixed chrome from the
//     viewport and reattach it to the transitioning wrapper instead.
//   - doesn't animate `exit` at all, on purpose: pairing this with
//     <AnimatePresence mode="wait"> to play an exit fade before the next
//     page mounts is a well-documented source of the outgoing page's exit
//     getting stuck and leaving a blank screen until a manual refresh.
//     There's no `exit` key here specifically so nothing reintroduces that
//     pattern by wrapping this in AnimatePresence again without reading
//     why it was removed.
// Kept as a separate export rather than editing pageTransition itself,
// which stays available as-is for any future spot (e.g. a modal) without a
// fixed-position descendant to worry about.
