/**
 * A tiny in-memory GET cache, scoped to the browser tab's lifetime. Every
 * admin list view re-fetches its full result set on mount (see e.g.
 * ApplicationsView/ReportsView's own session-gated useEffect) — without
 * this, switching between pages in the sidebar re-triggers that fetch
 * every single time, even seconds after the same data was just loaded.
 *
 * A module-level Map survives client-side navigation (Next.js's App
 * Router keeps the JS bundle loaded between page switches — it only
 * resets on a hard reload), so this needs no provider or storage of its
 * own. Concurrent callers for the same key share one in-flight request
 * instead of firing duplicate ones.
 *
 * Mutations must call `invalidate()` for the resource they changed, or
 * the next visit to that list will keep serving the pre-mutation cache
 * until it naturally expires.
